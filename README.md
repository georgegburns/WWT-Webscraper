# WWT-Webscraper
I built this specifically for WWT to scrape reviews from GoogleReviews and TripAdvisor. 
<br>
<br>
I used Python, Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape the websites.
<br>
There is no user input but in the future I'd like to improve upon this concept, making the code work on any website and having a frontend. 
<br> 
I also started doing some text analysis using nltk. 
<br>
The plan was to train machine learning on these webscraped reviews so that we could have numerical ratings for non-rated reviews such as survey responses etc. 
<br>
I started doing a bit of machine learning using Tensorflow but I was only able to achieve 67% accuracy and industry standard is around 80%.
<br> 
<br>
Perhaps in the future experiment more with machine learning.
